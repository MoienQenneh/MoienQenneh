# 👋 Hi, I’m Mo’ien AlQenneh

**Senior / Staff Software Engineer – Cloud & AI Platforms**

I’m a hands-on software engineer with 10+ years of experience designing, building, and scaling
**cloud-native and AI-enabled systems** for enterprise and business-critical platforms.

I specialize in **backend and platform engineering**, focusing on **system design, distributed systems,
and cloud architecture**. I enjoy working on complex problems that require deep technical thinking,
clean architecture, and long-term scalability.
