# 👋 Hi, I’m Mo’ien AlQenneh

**Senior / Staff Software Engineer – Cloud & AI Platforms**

I’m a hands-on software engineer with 10+ years of experience designing, building, and scaling
**cloud-native and AI-enabled systems** for enterprise and business-critical platforms.

I specialize in **backend and platform engineering**, focusing on **system design, distributed systems,
and cloud architecture**. I enjoy working on complex problems that require deep technical thinking,
clean architecture, and long-term scalability.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Design and evolve **cloud-native architectures** on **Azure & AWS**
- Build **scalable backend systems** using **.NET, Node.js, and FastAPI**
- Architect **distributed systems & microservices**
- Own **SQL and data-layer performance** for high-traffic systems
- Integrate **AI-enabled capabilities** into production platforms
- Drive **architecture decisions**, code reviews, and engineering best practices
- Mentor engineers and raise overall system quality
